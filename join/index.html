    <h1>Join Unscriptulous</h1>
    <p>We’re looking for new ensemble members who love imaginative, character-led storytelling and thrive in a team that’s creative, expressive, and unafraid to explore the edges of humour and emotion.</p>

    <a class="back-home" href="/">← Back to Home</a>

    <h2>Experience & Training</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Completion of <strong>Free Association Level 3</strong> (or equivalent training) is the minimum we expect — ideally, applicants will have progressed beyond this or have equivalent experience at another top improv school.</li>
      <li>Experience in narrative improv — either through team performance or the <strong>Free Association Narrative Course</strong> (or similar at another long-form school) — is required.</li>
      <li>Experience performing with teams in other improv formats is a plus.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who We’re Looking For</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Adventurous, generous performers who are comfortable taking creative risks together. We value openness, empathy, and the ability to connect with both fellow players and audiences through honesty and play.</li>
      <li><strong>Gen Z improvisers:</strong> Passionate about shaping the future of narrative improv in London, bringing energy, perspective, and a hunger to experiment.</li>
      <li><strong>Underrepresented voices:</strong> We especially encourage applications from <span class="acronym" data-full="FLINTA*: women, lesbian, intersex, non-binary, trans, agender">FLINTA*</span>, <span class="acronym" data-full="LGBTQ+: lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer/questioning, and others">LGBTQ+</span> and <em>ethnic minority</em> background players. We’re committed to building a team that reflects the full diversity of the communities we perform for.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Commitment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Rehearsals take place every other week, with regular performances in London.</li>
      <li>A shared commitment to creating excellent, high-quality improv.</li>
      <li>A willingness to take on and complete necessary administrative or organisational roles — from show logistics to production or marketing — to help the team operate professionally.</li>
      <li>We’re looking for players who can prioritise this ensemble alongside their other projects — ideally those not spread across too many teams — so they can contribute consistently and with focus.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Apply</h2>
    <p>If this sounds like you, send a short note about your experience and why you’d like to join to <a href="mailto:hello@unscriptulous.com">hello@unscriptulous.com</a>. Please include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your current teams or projects.</li>
      <li>Your improv training and schools attended.</li>
      <li>Links to your social media handles (Instagram, TikTok, etc.).</li>
      <li>Any professional or creative skills (e.g., design, production, admin, marketing) that could help the team run smoothly.</li>
    </ul>
